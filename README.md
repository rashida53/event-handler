## Description
This repository follows the MVC paradigm and thus contains the routes, views, javaScript, models, seeds and server.js files for the project two. It is an app for posting upcoming events in the neighborhood and posting errands that one would like to get done.

- Get all events
- Get a single event
- Get all errands
- Create and delete an event
- Create an errand
- RSVP for an event
- Get count for events
- Post email through ethereal
- Get nearby restaurants through google API

## [**Usage**](#table-of-contents)
The everrands app enables people in a neighborhood to connect over gatherings that can be posted on the app. A user can view the event and enter a count of people attending from friends and family. The host is then notified via email of the `RSVP count of number of people and for which particular event`. The host of an event can look up catering options in the neighborhood by entering a dish name which renders nearby restaurants serving that dish through `google API`. The app also allows users to create errands and provide their contact details and pay for that errand which other neighborhood people can then respond to.
